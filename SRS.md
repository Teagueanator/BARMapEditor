# Beyond All Reason GUI Map Editor — Research, Feasibility, SRS, and Stack

**TL;DR**
- BAR/Recoil maps are a tractable bundle of a binary SMF + tiled DXT1 SMT + a Lua manifest, glued together by one mature compiler (Beherith's PyMapConv). A standalone editor is feasible **only if** it treats PyMapConv as the build backend rather than re-implementing SMF/SMT compilation from scratch.
- The dominant hidden cost is not the GUI — it is the **texture pipeline at map scale**: a competitive 16×16 BAR map needs an 8192² diffuse + 8192² normal + 4096² splat distribution, all chunked into 32×32 DXT1 tiles. That dominates memory, disk, and compile time.
- Recommended stack: **Rust + egui/eframe + wgpu**, shipping a single static binary on Windows and Linux, with PyMapConv bundled as a sidecar. Tauri is the runner-up; Unity, Electron, and Java are rejected on packaging or performance grounds.

## Phase 1 — Research Findings

### 1.1 Engine context

Beyond All Reason runs on **Recoil**, a hard fork by the BAR team from the Spring RTS engine 105 tree (repo: `beyond-all-reason/RecoilEngine`, GPL-2.0; 552 stars / 220 forks as of May 2026 per the releases page; current release tag 2025.06.21). The Recoil wiki, last edited by maintainer `lhog` on 29 Mar 2024, states: *"Recoil RTS engine is a continuation and significant extension of the original Spring RTS engine version 105.0."* Practical implication: Spring-era map documentation is still the authoritative reference.

### 1.2 Map file anatomy

A BAR map ships as either an `.sd7` (7-Zip) or `.sdz` (Zip) archive containing:

```
mymap.sd7/
  maps/mymap.smf         -- binary: header + heightmap + tile indices + minimap + metalmap
  maps/mymap.smt         -- tile file: stream of 32×32 DXT1-compressed tiles
  maps/*.dds / *.png     -- normal, specular, splat distribution, DNTS detail, skybox, grass
  mapinfo.lua            -- single Lua table: atmosphere, lighting, water, splats, terrainTypes
  mapoptions.lua         -- optional player-tweakable knobs (e.g. WaterLevel presets)
  LuaGaia/, LuaRules/    -- optional gadgets (feature placement, custom rules)
```

**SMF binary** (from `spring/rts/Map/SMF/SMFFormat.h` plus the wiki SMF decompiler source): the header carries `mapx`, `mapy`, `squareSize=8`, `texelPerSquare=8`, `tileSize=32`, `minHeight`, `maxHeight`, then file offsets to heightmap (`short[(mapy+1)*(mapx+1)]`), typemap (`uint8[mapy/2 * mapx/2]`), tile-index data, minimap (always 1024×1024 DXT1 + 8 mipmap sublevels = exactly 699 048 bytes), metalmap (`uint8[mapx/2 * mapy/2]`), and an optional feature header.

**SMT tiles:** magic `"spring tilefile"`, version 1, tileSize 32, compressionType 1 (DXT1). The diffuse texture is sliced into 32×32 pixel tiles, deduplicated against a hash table, DXT1-compressed, and packed sequentially. The SMF references tiles by 4-byte indices into this pool.

**Image size rules** (per Spring `MakingMapsWithBluePrintAndMapConv` and the Zero-K mapping guide):

| Asset | Dimensions (Spring Map Units, where 1 SMU = 512 px texture = 64 px heightmap = 512 elmos world) |
|---|---|
| Texture map | `(512 × N)²`, must be multiples of 1024 |
| Heightmap | `(64 × N + 1)²`, 16-bit `.raw` or 16-bit `.png` preferred |
| Metal map | `(32 × N)²`, red channel = density |
| Type map | `(32 × N)²`, greyscale → terrain type index |
| Feature map | `(64 × N)²` (legacy pixel placement; superseded by Lua feature lists) |
| Grass map | `(16 × N)²` |
| Minimap | always 1024 × 1024 |

For a 16×16 BAR map: 8192² texture (~6 GB raw RGBA), 1025² heightmap, 512² metal/type, 256² grass. **Coordinates:** Spring uses a left-handed Y-up system; **8 elmos per heightmap texel**, **16 elmos per metal/type texel**, **1 elmo = 1 world unit**.

### 1.3 mapinfo.lua (BAR conventions)

Single returned Lua table with sections `smf`, `resources`, `splats`, `atmosphere`, `lighting`, `water`, `terrainTypes`, `grass`, `teams`, `custom`. BAR-typical resource entries are PBR-style: `detailTex`, `specularTex`, `splatDistrTex`, `splatDetailTex`, `splatDetailNormalTex1..4` (DNTS — Detail Normal Texture Splatting, in DDS), `detailNormalTex`, `skyReflectModTex`. `splats.texScales` and `texMults` tune each of 4 RGBA channels of the splat distribution map. `voidWater = true` combined with omitting `water.planeColor` produces the popular "space map" look (e.g. *Apophis*, *Quicksilver*). **`splatDetailNormalTex` requires a `specularTex` to be defined or it silently disables.**

**STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17 (Stage 0 goal #7 findings):** the "required vs optional" calculus has three independent layers, NOT one — see `docs/PITFALLS.md` §"BAR Chobby + mod-gadget mapinfo expectations":

1. **Engine scanner**: only `name`, `smf.smtFileName0`, and `teams[*].startPos` are strictly required (per `burnhamrobertp/97cae4d300e675ca261e661fc58266d1` gist — the de-facto BAR map-format reference).
2. **Chobby map browser** (`beyond-all-reason/BYAR-Chobby` `LuaMenu/widgets/gui_maplist_panel.lua`): requires `modtype == 3` and the map must be in Chobby's "certified maps" list to appear in multiplayer lobbies. **Unofficial maps only appear in Skirmish / singleplayer.** The `GetMinimapImage not found` warning is benign — auto-extracted from SMF on first scan.
3. **BAR mod gadgets** (e.g. `luarules/gadgets/unit_sunfacing.lua`): read mapinfo subtables (`lighting`, `atmosphere`, `water`, …) directly without nil-checking. Missing subtables crash gadget load → game hangs at "waiting for players". The emitter MUST include conventional subtables with sensible defaults even though the engine itself would tolerate omission.

The `barme-pipeline::mapinfo` emitter's field set is calibrated to satisfy all three layers, and grows as new gadget nil-derefs are discovered. The list of subtables is not a Lua schema — it's a "minimum set BAR's mod gadgets won't crash on".

### 1.4 Existing toolchain (active vs. legacy)

| Tool | Stack | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PyMapConv** (Beherith / `springrts_smf_compiler`) | Python 3 + PyQt + nvdxt.exe | **Active, canonical.** Forum consensus 2021–2025: "deprecate all other mapconvs and make pymapconv 'the' mapconv." | SMF + SMT compile/decompile, GUI + CLI, ships a Windows one-file `.exe`; Linux runs from source — **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17 (ADR-011):** v0.6.3 ships a self-contained Linux ELF bundle (PyInstaller; ~90 MB extracted). No Python 3, PyQt, or Pillow install required on Linux. Upstream `--help` is broken in v0.6.3 (argparse crash); flag surface is captured in `devlog/stage-0-validation/logs/2026-05-17T16-57-48__pymapconv-vendoring.md`. **CORRECTION 2026-05-17 (ADR-014):** the bundled `tools/dragon-dxt1`, `tools/dragon-dxt5`, `tools/magick` are auxiliary GUI converters, *not* the `--linux`-mode compile path's dependency — that path shells out to `CompressonatorCLI` by name (upstream `src/pymapconv.py` lines 828 + 1032, no path override). Compressonator is therefore vendored separately under `tools/compressonator/` via `scripts/fetch-compressonator.sh`. The PyMapConv subprocess driver also passes `-q 1` to work around a v0.6.3 read-back bug (multi-thread tile path expected on Linux but tiles are written flat) and treats artifact-presence as the success contract (PyMapConv exits 1 on Linux even after a clean compile — bundled Qt event loop quirk). All recorded in `devlog/stage-0-validation/logs/2026-05-17T17-24-52__pymapconv-subprocess-driver.md`. |
| **SpringBoard** (gajop / `Spring-SpringBoard`) | Lua, runs *inside* Spring/Recoil | 0.5.3 announced by gajop on 23 Sep 2017, last forum activity 6 Dec 2018; BYAR variant exists but is inactive | Most feature-complete editor: heightmap raise/set/smooth, DNTS/specular/diffuse painting, void tool, feature & unit placement, undo/redo. *In-engine, not standalone.* |
| **SpringMapConvNG** (tizbac) | C++ + DevIL | Legacy (last meaningful work 2023) | Cross-platform CLI compiler; historical Win32 free() crash |
| **SpringMapEdit** (Heiko Schmitt → aeonios) | Java + SWT + JOGL | Abandoned (~2009–2012) | Standalone 3D editor: brushes, hydraulic/thermal erosion, auto-texture, mirror/flip/shift; no metal/feature/sd7 |
| **World Machine** | Commercial Windows app | Active | Procedural terrain + texture generator; Beherith ships a `.tmd` template for BAR. CPU/RAM intensive (16 GB RAM for a 16×16 final render) |
| **hendkai/bar-map-generator** | Web JS UI + Python | Early (2024–2025), self-described unfinished | Procedural generator that shells out to PyMapConv; not an editor |
| **tebeer/BARMapEdit** | Unity (C#) + Dear ImGui + custom HLSL | Personal/dormant: 22 commits, 0 stars, no LICENSE, no README, not on the official BAR mapmaking-resources page | Earliest-stage standalone GUI attempt. **Not a viable fork base.** |
| **Jandodev/bar-editor** | Vite + Vue 3 + TypeScript + Three.js (WebGL) | Early but usable (2025+); MIT | In-browser SPA editor. Reads `.smf` natively in TypeScript (no PyMapConv dep), terrain brushes (Add/Remove/Smooth + Flatten/Erode/Terrace), SMF save/export working; package export WIP. Polar-opposite architecture to ours (browser vs native single-binary); their TypeScript SMF parser is a useful reference for our Stage 1+ decompile-import. Found 2026-05-17 during goal #7 work. |
| Legacy MapConv variants (`spring/MapConv`, `pajohns/MapConv`, `enetheru/smf_tools`) | C++ | Legacy | Original CLI compilers requiring nvdxt.exe |
| **Feature Placer** | rapid tag `feature-placer:test` | Active | Spring-based 3D feature painter that exports `set.lua` |

**Beherith's recommended pipeline today** (per the *Advanced SpringRTS Mapping Guide* Google Doc and `beyondallreason.info/guide/mapmaking-resources`): World Machine (using his `.tmd` template) → PyMapConv → SpringBoard for DNTS painting and feature finetuning → 7-Zip into `.sd7`.

### 1.5 Distribution

BAR maps are curated through `github.com/beyond-all-reason/maps-metadata` (Apache-2.0, TypeScript; source-of-truth is `map_list.yaml`, generated from a Rowy table at `rowy.beyondallreason.dev`). Chobby (the lobby) auto-downloads via `pr-downloader`/rapid. Custom maps not in the curated list can simply be dropped into `Beyond-All-Reason/data/maps/`. There is no per-map review API; approval is human-mediated via Discord.

### 1.6 Planetary Annihilation reference UX

PA's in-game system designer is the cited gold standard. It does the following well, and the BAR editor should mirror:
- **Biome dropdown** (desert / earth / metal / ice / lava / asteroid / tropical) drives terrain + texture set in one click.
- Single **radius**, single **height-range**, and a **temperature** slider that re-colors the texture distribution rather than just toggling biomes.
- **Water-depth** slider with gameplay-aware semantics (deep = naval, shallow = hover/amphib).
- **Symmetry** toggles: terrain mirror, CSG mirror, metal/spawn mirror — non-negotiable for competitive maps.
- **Brush-based sculpting** (raise/lower/flatten/smooth) with seed-based regeneration so a "looks-bad" planet is one click away from rerolling.
- **Preview Terrain** vs. **Preview Gameplay** toggle — same camera, different overlay.

---

## Phase 2 — Feasibility Analysis (with Hidden Pitfalls)

**Verdict: feasible by one motivated CS student in 9–15 months to MVP, provided the editor delegates SMF/SMT compilation to PyMapConv as a bundled sidecar.** Re-implementing SMF/SMT compilation natively is a 3-month detour with negligible upside, and reintroduces the texture-dedupe + nvdxt headaches that PyMapConv has already solved.

### 2.1 Pitfalls that will actually hurt

1. **Texture pipeline memory.** A 16×16 map = 8192² diffuse. Holding it uncompressed (256 MB RGBA) + an 8192² normal (256 MB) + a 4096² splat distribution (64 MB) + an undo stack is trivially 2–4 GB resident. Use a **tiled copy-on-write 256×256 chunk model** with an LRU disk cache; never snapshot-undo a whole heightmap.
2. **DXT1 compression is slow and lossy.** PyMapConv invokes `nvdxt.exe` (NVIDIA's legacy DXT compressor, Windows binary; runs under Wine on Linux). Quality-tuned compression of a 16×16 takes 1–10 minutes. Use **bc1 (texpresso, bcdec/bcenc, or ISPC Texture Compressor) in-process for live preview**, fall back to nvdxt for final-quality `.smt`. The SMT format mandates DXT1 specifically (`compressionType=1, tileSize=32`); BC7 is not an option. — **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17 (ADR-004):** upstream PyMapConv now uses AMD Compressonator (native Linux binary, open-source) in place of `nvdxt.exe`. No Wine dependency on Linux. Live-preview BC1 still warranted for sub-second feedback, but the "fall back to nvdxt" leg of this pitfall collapses.
3. **Tile deduplication.** The SMT format hash-deduplicates 32×32 tiles. Naïve output produces SMTs roughly 4× larger than tuned output. PyMapConv has the deduplicator; if you ever fork it, port the hash table verbatim.
4. **Heightmap edge constraint.** Must be exactly `(64·N + 1)²` — **not** a power of two. Crop/pad logic for image import is the #1 silent failure mode (mapconv warns + resizes, producing visibly wrong terrain).
5. **Coordinate sign flips.** Spring is Y-up, left-handed. Heightmap pixel `(x, y)` corresponds to world `(x·8, height, y·8)`. The `-i / --invert` mapconv flag exists because of historical row-order confusion. Lua features use `{x, z, rot}` in world elmos. Pick one convention internally and bake it in.
6. **mapinfo.lua silent dependencies.** `splatDetailNormalTex` requires `specularTex`; `voidWater` requires unsetting `water.planeColor`; missing or renamed `smtFileName0` produces the **infamous pink map**; `fogStart == fogEnd` (e.g. both 1.0) breaks the ground-grid renderer. The editor must run a linter pass before save.
7. **Pink-map trap on rename.** Historically the SMT filename was hardcoded into the SMF; modern Recoil allows override via `mapinfo.smf.smtFileName0`. The editor must rewrite mapinfo whenever the SMT is renamed.
8. **DNTS + water + LOS bug** (Beherith, springrts forum t=35202): with `minHeight < 0` plus DNTS plus a Lua widget that touches LOS, you get animated TV-snow artifacts. Warn when DNTS is enabled on a water map.
9. **`.sd7` solidity.** 7-Zip solid archives are silently rejected by SpringFiles indexing. The packager must emit **non-solid** archives.
10. **License of the output stack.** Recoil is GPL-2.0; legacy mapconv binaries are GPL-2.0; **PyMapConv has no SPDX-declared license**. Redistributing PyMapConv inside your installer requires explicit written permission from Beherith. This is a hard prerequisite. — **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17 (ADR-003):** upstream now carries an SPDX `CC0-1.0` LICENSE file. Redistribution is unrestricted; the "ask Beherith for written permission" workstream is removed (we still credit him in `CREDITS.md` out of courtesy).
11. **3D preview ≠ in-game rendering.** Recoil's actual ground shader (DNTS + splats + PBR + atmospheric scatter + dynamic shadows) is non-trivial; the editor preview will be an approximation. Document this up front; do not pretend WYSIWYG.

    > policy reversed. The editor's renderer is being upgraded across

    > validation) is **Sprints 20–27** in the new numbering; the
    > "reproduce within ΔE < 5.0" target carries over unchanged.
12. **Decompilation fidelity.** Round-tripping an existing `.sd7` loses information: the recovered diffuse PNG has been through DXT1 (color precision loss); heightmap, metal, and type maps are exact; mapinfo.lua is exact; auxiliary splat textures survive untouched. Reuse PyMapConv's decompile path.
13. **GPU brush latency.** Spring/Recoil maps can theoretically reach 96×96 SMUs. Sub-millisecond brush response at 32×32+ requires the heightmap to live on the GPU as a storage texture, edited by compute shaders. Read-back to CPU happens only at save.

### 2.2 Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| PyMapConv breaks on a new Recoil release | M | H | Vendor a pinned PyMapConv build; CI test against the latest Recoil release tag |
| nvdxt.exe unavailable on Linux native / ARM | H | M | Bundle a native BC1 encoder (texpresso / bcdec) for in-tool preview & builds; keep nvdxt only for final-quality compile — **STATUS 2026-05-17 (ADR-004):** PyMapConv now uses AMD Compressonator (native Linux); risk collapses to L/L.** |
| Beherith refuses redistribution of PyMapConv | L | H | Fallback: download PyMapConv at first launch (the Springboard model) |
| Memory blow-out at 32×32+ map sizes | M | H | Tiled COW edit buffer, disk-backed undo |
| Editor outputs invalid mapinfo.lua | H | M | Schema validator + headless test using Recoil `--isolation` pre-release |
| Scope creep into a generic Spring editor | H | M | Lock to BAR conventions in MVP; expose Spring-genericity as v2 |

## Phase 3 — SRS / SRD

### 3.1 Vision

A single-window, single-executable desktop app that produces a *playable* BAR map from an empty project to a tested `.sd7`, on both Windows and Linux, with the UX feel of Planetary Annihilation's system designer.

### 3.2 Functional requirements

| # | Requirement | MVP | v1 | v2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | New-project wizard: size (units), biome preset, symmetry mode | ✅ | | |
| F2 | Real-time heightmap sculpting: raise/lower/flatten/smooth/erode/ramp | ✅ | | |
| F3 | Symmetry enforcement (mirror H/V/diag/rot-N) on heightmap and overlays | ✅ | | |
| F4 | Texture painting via DNTS splat channels (4 RGBA, ≤4 splat textures) | ✅ | | |
| **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (Sprint 9 / D4 + D5):** ||||
| F4 editor-preview half landed — D4 (ADR-036) wires the GPU bind group + WGSL composite (diffuse-only simplification of `SMFFragProg.glsl:174-198`, FINDINGS §7 corrections internalised). D5 ships the persisted `Project.splat_config` (per-channel slot bindings + `tex_scales` / `tex_mults` / `diffuse_in_alpha`) and the inspector that drives it. Painting works in the editor; the painted distribution does NOT yet flow into the `.sd7` — D6 (Sprint 12) wires `mapinfo.resources.splatDetailNormalTex` emission + the `splat_distribution.png` sidecar. The pitfall #6 line at §2.1 below is **updated by FINDINGS §7.2**: engine no longer gates DNTS on `specularTex`; the lint stays as a yellow warning. ||||
| F5 | Metal-spot placement (point + radius → red-channel density on metal map) | ✅ | | |
| F6 | Geo-vent placement | ✅ | | |
| **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-19 (Sprint 11 / C4 + C5):** F5 and F6 shipped. ||||
| `Project.metal_spots: Vec<MetalSpot { x_elmo, z_elmo, metal }>` + `Project.geo_vents: Vec<GeoVent>` + `Project.extractor_radius: f32` (default 80, BAR convention). Pipeline emits `mapconfig/map_metal_layout.lua` `spots = { [N] = { x, z, metal } }` and stages an all-zero `(32 × smu_x) × (32 × smu_z)` metalmap PNG to PyMapConv via `-m` when metal spots are authored — PITFALL §13 + FINDINGS §5. Geo vents emit through the Springboard featureplacer trio (see UPDATE below) with `name = "geovent"` (no `geos = {}` array — PITFALL §14 / FINDINGS §5–§6). Canvas: LMB place / drag, RMB delete; symmetry replicates sources as `ProjectDiff::PlaceMetalSpot` / `PlaceGeoVent` per-mirror so undo peels one at a time (matches F8 / B5). Cross-tool ghost at 50 % alpha per B1 / ADR-030. Inspector exposes per-mex metal as a `DragValue` (range 0..=50, not slider-capped — strategic placements can be 0.5 perimeter or 5.2 central). `extractor_radius` Inspector tooltip flags PITFALL §6 (engine default 500 breaks BAR's mex-snap; must stay at 80). 38 new tests across barme-core (project model round-trip, migration of legacy projects, undo bytes accounting), barme-pipeline (spots emit + no-geos regression + black metalmap PNG dims + all-zero bytes), and barme-app (place/move/delete diffs, symmetry expansion through `snapshot_project_for_build`, new-project / open round-trips). ||||
| **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-19 (Sprint 11 hotfix — first live-BAR smoke test):** Three regressions surfaced when the user loaded a freshly-built `.sd7` into BAR. All fixed before this STATUS line lands. ||||
| 1. **Geo vents weren't spawning.** The C5 emitter wrote `mapconfig/featureplacer/features.lua` — a path with NO consumer in BAR (verified by grep across the full Beyond-All-Reason checkout: zero matches in `luarules/`, `luaui/`, `common/`). Real BAR maps (`gecko_isle_remake_v1.2.1`, `jade_empress_1.3`, `titanduel_v3`, …) ship the **Springboard featureplacer trio**: a vendored `LuaGaia/Gadgets/FP_featureplacer.lua` (PD-licensed Gnome/Smoth 2008 gadget) + `mapconfig/featureplacer/config.lua` (one-liner redirect) + `mapconfig/featureplacer/set.lua` (`{ objectlist = {…}, unitlist = {}, buildinglist = {} }`). The build pipeline now stages all three; rotation in `set.lua` is an **unquoted integer** (the gadget calls `Spring.CreateFeature(..., fDef.rot)` which expects a number) — that's a different shape from PyMapConv's `-k` flat-text format which uses quoted strings. PITFALL §14 + new §21 + §23 capture the convention. ||||
| 2. **Metal yield displayed as 0.1 m/s for a metal=2.0 spot.** Root cause: `MapInfo::bar_default().max_metal = 0.02` — 50× lower than the BAR median. Real BAR maps cluster in `0.93..=4.11` (jade_empress 0.99, titanduel 1.26, supreme_isthmus 0.93, starwatcher 4.11). `gui_metalspots.lua` computes displayed income as `spot.worth * incomeMultiplier / 1000` where `spot.worth` scales linearly with `mapinfo.maxMetal`. Default flipped to `1.0` (BAR median, ensures a canonical metal=2.0 spot reads ~2.0 m/s in F4 without per-project tuning). New PITFALL §22 documents the scale + the lint rule (warn outside `0.5..=5.0`). ||||
| 3. **Start positions appeared missing in BAR.** Diagnosis: the user's stale `.sd7` was from before Sprint 10's mapinfo audit fixes (`sunDir.w = 1e9` instead of `1.0` — PITFALL §18; deprecated `skyDir` instead of `skyAxisAngle` — PITFALL §12). The emitted `teams[i].startPos` itself was correct (verified by extracting the user's `teague-test-2.sd7`: 4 entries present with x/z coords). The likely cause is BAR refusing to load the map cleanly because of the broken `sunDir.w`. Sprint 10's fixes are on `main` already; a fresh rebuild produces a working mapinfo. Symmetry rounding also produced duplicate sources on the axis (off-by-1 in z); a follow-up could dedup more aggressively but the BAR engine tolerates it. ||||
| **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-19 (Sprint 11 hotfix — second live-BAR smoke test):** The first-smoke-test hotfix above didn't resolve everything. Two further blocking issues surfaced when the user retested with a fresh build. Both fixed before this STATUS line lands. ||||
| 1. **Geo vents *still* didn't spawn.** The Springboard trio was staged correctly (verified by extracting the user's `untitled.sd7`: `LuaGaia/Gadgets/FP_featureplacer.lua` + `mapconfig/featureplacer/{config,set}.lua` all present with the right shape), but the gadget itself was never being loaded. Comparing to `gecko_isle_remake_v1.2.1.sd7` revealed the missing piece: real BAR maps ship a **LuaGaia bootstrap pair** at `LuaGaia/main.lua` + `LuaGaia/draw.lua` whose only job is to `VFS.Include("LuaGadgets/gadgets.lua", nil, VFS.BASE)`. Without `main.lua`, the engine never scans `LuaGaia/Gadgets/` on map load and our featureplacer is dead code. The engine's `springcontent.sdz` (verified against recoil 2026.06.04) provides the `LuaGadgets/gadgets.lua` handler but **NOT** a fallback bootstrap, so the map MUST ship its own. New `featureplacer::LUAGAIA_{MAIN,DRAW}_SOURCE` vendor the two-liners byte-for-byte from `gecko_isle_remake_v1.2.1.sd7`; `build_sd7` stages them at `LuaGaia/main.lua` + `LuaGaia/draw.lua`. PITFALL §25 captures the rule. ||||
| 2. **Recommended spawn area / start position invisible in skirmish.** Two entangled bugs in `mapconfig/map_startboxes.lua`. (a) **Wrong shape:** we emitted `return { startboxes = {} }`. Real BAR maps return the per-ally-team table directly (verified against `titanduel_v3.sd7`: `return { [0] = { boxes = {…}, startpoints = {…}, nameLong = …, nameShort = … }, [1] = … }`). `luarules/gadgets/include/startbox_utilities.lua:44` does `startBoxConfig = WrappedInclude(mapsideBoxes)` and uses the returned table as-is — no `startboxes` key is dereferenced. (b) **Existence beats content:** the same file's line 43 checks `VFS.FileExists` only; shipping an empty file shadows BAR's default-fallback codepath at lines 79–137 (which would otherwise generate sensible N/S or E/W boxes from map dimensions). Fix: new `startboxes::should_emit(project)` returns `false` when no ally group has an authored `box_polygon`, and `build_sd7` skips staging the file in that case — BAR's fallback then kicks in. When emitted, the file uses the unwrapped per-ally-team shape with **elmo-space** polygon coordinates (not 0..1 fractions; the modoptions-string codepath does multiply by `Game.mapSizeX/Z`, but the map-file codepath does not — these are two different formats that happen to share field names). `startpoints` gets one entry at the polygon centroid in elmos. PITFALL §26 captures both halves. ||||
| **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-19 (Sprint 12 / C6 + D6):** F4 round-trip closes; F7 ships. ||||
| **C6 (F7 placement):** `Project.features: Vec<FeatureInstance { name, x_elmo, z_elmo, rot_heading }>` plus a new `Tool::Feature` (keyboard `F`; the geo-vent tool moved to `V` to free F). Inspector ships a category combo + filtered picker fed from `assets/mapfeatures_catalog.json` (hand-curated 30-entry baseline sourced from `github.com/beyond-all-reason/mapfeatures` — auto-generation from the upstream repo is a polish task). Canvas: LMB places the picker-selected feature; LMB-drag rotates the hit instance (heading delta = `dx × 182`, ~1° per pixel; matches the `mathAtan2 × (COBSCALE / …)` scale BAR's `unit_sunfacing.lua` uses); RMB deletes. Cross-tool ghost at 50 % alpha per B1. Symmetry mirrors replicate sources; rotational fold N rotates each copy's `rot_heading` by `65536 / fold` so per-sector visuals stay symmetric. Emission: `featureplacer::object_entries` walks geo vents first (sorted `(z, x)`) then user features (sorted `(name, z, x)`) into the Springboard `set.lua`'s `objectlist`. Rotation is the UNQUOTED Lua integer the gadget's `Spring.CreateFeature(..., fDef.rot)` consumes — PITFALL §23. The earlier Sprint 11 STATUS line for F6 saying "`rot` is string-quoted per PITFALL §6 (FINDINGS §6 confirms…)" was stale — FINDINGS §6 actually describes PyMapConv's `-k` flat-text codepath (a separate tool we don't use); the existing C5 emit + tests already used the integer form. ||||
| **D6 (F4 round-trip):** new `barme-pipeline::splat_pipeline` module identifies active channels (bound + non-zero distribution pixels), bakes a DNTS DDS per active slot via D2's `bake_dnts`, writes the splat distribution PNG (1024² RGBA, defaults to saturated-R when no strokes — matches the editor's "unpainted = baseline" preview), ensures a 1024² grey BC1 specular fallback at `tools/textures-cache/<sha>.dds` (cached cross-project; reused via copy on subsequent builds), and populates `mapinfo.resources`. `From<&Project> for MapInfo` no longer owns the resources block — the pipeline mutates it after staging so the emitted paths reflect on-disk artefacts. Archive paths: `maps/textures/<slot-dir-name>_dnts.dds` per channel, `maps/<projectname>_splatdistr.png`, `maps/<projectname>_specular.dds`. ||||
| **PITFALL §15 — subtable form:** D6 emits `resources.splatDetailNormalTex = { "a.dds", "b.dds", "c.dds", "d.dds", alpha = false, }` (FINDINGS §1.8 — the engine's preferred reading; mixing with the legacy numbered keys silently shadows the subtable). A new `LuaValue::Mixed { values, keyed }` AST node renders the bare-positional + keyed shape real BAR maps ship. Legacy `splatDetailNormalTex1..4` stays in the schema for hand-authored import survival but D6 never emits it; the regression test `resources_subtable_form_not_legacy` pins both halves. ||||
| **Specular fallback:** FINDINGS §7.2 updated PITFALL §6 — the engine no longer gates DNTS on `specularTex` at the C++ render-state level (`SMFRenderState.cpp:114`). The visual result without spec is still noticeably flatter than published BAR maps, so D6 ships the grey-BC1 default whenever `Project.specular_tex_path.is_none()`. F9 (Sprint 13) will expose a path picker for user-supplied speculars. ||||
| **`build_sd7` signature change:** added a `splat_inputs: SplatBakeInputs` parameter. The app's launcher resolves each `Project.splat_config.channels[i]: Option<u8>` to its `tools/textures/<NN-slug>/` path via the slot registry; unbound channels stay `None`. Build smoke + example updated to pass `SplatBakeInputs::default()`. ||||
| **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-19 (Sprint 14 / C9 — ADR-042):** Water + Lava authoring shipped as a map-property tool — no separate F-row, slots adjacent to F2 (sculpting) + F4 (splat). ||||
| `Project.water_mode: WaterMode { None\|Ocean\|Tropical\|Acid\|Lava\|Magma\|Custom }` (`#[serde(other)]` on `Custom` for forward-compat) drives `From<&Project> for MapInfo`'s new merge flow: `preset_water_block(mode)` + `merge_overrides(&preset, &water_overrides)` → `info.water = Some(merged)`. Closes the silent omission where `bar_default_with_water()` was dead code and `From<&Project>` always shipped `info.water = None`. Each non-None preset is anchored to a real BAR map (Coastlines Dry, Gecko Isle Remake, Acidic Quarry; Lava + Magma synthesised at `damage = 1000` / `5000` — ground-block thresholds per `MoveDefHandler.cpp:81-160`). `Project.water_overrides: WaterBlock` (sparse `Option<…>` overlay) persists across preset changes (Photoshop-style). `Project.{void_water, tidal_strength}` shadow MapInfo top-level fields; PITFALL §6 auto-resolve clears `plane_color` when `void_water = true` + `warn!`s. ||||
| **`Tool::Water`** (keyboard `W`, 9th variant): LMB-drag floods via `Brush::Lower` (strength derived from a per-session `water_carve_depth` — default −80 elmos, scaled against the project's `height_scale`); RMB-drag raises. Reuses the existing brush registry + symmetry fan + undo stack — no new brush. Inspector ships Preset (7 chips) / Behaviour (damage / void_water / tidal_strength) / Appearance (surface + plane colour + alpha + wave/foam) / Flood (carve_depth + auto-set min_height) / Advanced (placeholder for Sprint 18's F9 raw-fields backstop). Every edit emits a `ProjectDiff::EditWaterField` (or `SetWaterMode` / `SetLavaAtmosphere`) for undo. ||||
| **Renderer MVP**: new `crates/barme-app/src/water.wgsl` — flat alpha-blended quad at `y = 0` covering the map extent, tinted by `merged.surface_color × surface_alpha` (CPU pre-multiplied). Depth-test on, depth-write off; draws AFTER terrain (cliffs occlude via depth) and BEFORE markers/lines (brush rings stay on top). Cross-tool ghost at 0.5× alpha when `Tool::Water` is inactive. Polished water (fresnel, foam, caustics, lava emission, perlin wave motion) is the renderer-parity arc's job (Sprint 20+); the flat tinted plane alone makes the feature self-explanatory. ||||
| **Lava-atmosphere offer**: a single `Project.lava_atmosphere: bool` toggles a hardcoded `apply_lava_atmosphere_patch` (red-orange fog, dim warm sun, dusty clouds @ 0.7) the emission path applies on top of `bar_default()`. Inspector surfaces it as an offer card in the Preset section when `water_mode in {Lava, Magma}`. Independent of `water_mode` so the user can apply it freely. Coarser than per-field atmosphere editing; Sprint 18's F9 form ships the granular surface. ||||
| **Schema-versioned migration**: `Project.schema_v: u32` (Sprint 14 sets `v = 1`). On load of a pre-Sprint-14 file with `min_height < 0` and default `water_mode`, the migration sets `water_mode = Ocean` and bumps `schema_v`. Runs exactly once per project — re-saved files skip it. Critical for the case where a user explicitly chose `None` on a `min_height < 0` map; that choice survives reload. ||||
| **Validation chip** extensions: three new WARN messages (`DNTS + water: LOS bug` — PITFALL §8 / Beherith forum t=35202; `Terrain below Y=0 with no water preset`; `Water preset set, no terrain below Y=0`). Sprint 19's lint pass will promote them to the dedicated panel with one-click fixes. `App.min_height: f32` now mirrors `Project.min_height` end-to-end — closes a Stage-1 bug where `snapshot_project` hard-coded `0.0` and silently dropped any wizard- or fixture-set value on first save. ||||
| Tests: +44 across the workspace (~30 in barme-core for water_presets / project / undo / mapinfo_schema; +4 in barme-pipeline for the new Lua keys; +10 in barme-app for water_draw + validation-chip + Tool::Water + WaterU layout pins). cargo fmt / clippy / test all green. ||||
| **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-19 (Sprint 15 / D8 — ADR-038):** Layered texture stack data model + CPU bake-to-diffuse shipped. Closes the user's "exported diffuse looks incredibly ugly" report (`crates/barme-app/src/launcher.rs::synth_biome_bmp`, commit `f1ab09b`): the `.sd7` now ships a real composited diffuse instead of a height-keyed biome ramp whenever the project's `Project.layers` is non-empty. ||||
| New `barme-core::layers` module — `LayerStack`, `TextureLayer { id, name, source: LayerSource { Slot \| Imported }, transform, color, blend: BlendMode::Normal, visible, locked, dnts_channel: Option<SplatChannel>, opacity, mask: LayerMask }`. Mask is a flat `Vec<u8>` at `512 × SMU` per side with base64 TOML serde for v1; the tiled-COW upgrade lands in Sprint 16 (D9 / ADR-039 — `LayerMask::write_rect` stub already in place so the brush dirty-rect upload pattern from ADR-018 plugs in without API churn). ||||
| Compositor: `LayerStack::bake_diffuse(size, &dyn SlotResolver) -> RgbImage`. Per-row rayon parallel (`par_chunks_mut`), per-layer rayon-parallel PNG decode (`SlotResolver: Sync` requirement so `image::open` doesn't serialise across cores), back-to-front alpha-over composite, sRGB-space tint/brightness, wallpaper-tiled bilinear sample (modulo — NOT edge-clamp), mirror-then-rotate transform (pinned by `bake_mirror_then_rotate_matches_reference`). Smoke: 4-SMU × 2-layer = 72 ms; ADR-038's 1.5 s target for 16-SMU × 8 layers is on track. ||||
| `Project.layers: LayerStack` with `#[serde(default)]` so pre-Sprint-15 `.barmeproj` files load with an empty stack. `Project::after_load_migrate(&dyn SlotResolver)` — idempotent, gated on `layers.is_empty()` — seeds one layer per bound DNTS channel via `LayerStack::migrate_from_splat_config` (preserves the user's slot bindings; the painted distribution stays on `splat_config` for the runtime DNTS path until Sprint 17 / D10 retires it). `Project::new` seeds a single-layer biome-base stack so fresh projects always exercise the layered bake path. ||||
| `ProjectDiff::{AddLayer, RemoveLayer, ReorderLayer, SetLayerProperty}` + a `LayerPropertyValue` typed union (name / transform / color / blend / visible / locked / opacity / dnts_channel / source). Mask-pixel edits are NOT a ProjectDiff in Sprint 15 — no brushes touch masks yet; Sprint 16 (D9) lands a separate per-stroke COW path adapted from ADR-033's heightmap-undo. The 100 MB undo-cap eviction stays honest by folding mask + string capacities into `ProjectDiff::bytes()`. ||||
| `barme-app::launcher::build_and_install` grows a `slot_resolver: &dyn SlotResolver` parameter and a three-way texture branch: caller BMP → use as-is; non-empty stack → `bake_diffuse`; empty stack → `synth_biome_bmp` fallback (covers `barme-pipeline::examples::build_smoke` + integration tests that build bare `Project`s directly). New `crates/barme-app/examples/bake_layered_smoke.rs` exercises a two-layer composite end-to-end (grass base + half-covered desert layer at 50% opacity) and writes `/tmp/bake_layered_smoke.bmp` for visual inspection. ||||
| Tests: +27 across the workspace (barme-core 196 → 221, mostly layer round-trips + migrations + ProjectDiff bytes accounting; barme-app 232 → 234, +2 launcher pins for the layered bake + empty-stack fallback). PyMapConv's downstream DXT1 quantisation drifts chroma on saturated gradients — within the renderer-parity arc's ΔE < 5.0 target; Sprint 19's lint pass will flag if it exceeds. cargo fmt / clippy / test all green. ||||
| **Out of scope (Sprint 15)** — no paint UI (Sprint 16 / D9), no GPU composite pipeline (Sprint 16 / D9 / ADR-039), no tiled-COW masks (Sprint 16 / D9), no DNTS hybrid emission (Sprint 17 / D10 / ADR-041; splat distribution + DNTS DDS continue to come from Sprint 12 / D6's `splat_pipeline` unchanged), no retirement of `inspector_splat` / `Tool::SplatPaint` (Sprint 17 / D10). Sprint 17 will also offer a one-time migration from pre-D8 splat painting into mask pixels when the user first opens an older project. ||||
| **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-19 (Sprint 16 / D9 — ADR-039 + ADR-040):** Layered painter UI + GPU live preview shipped. The user can now paint into per-layer masks via a new top-down 2D paint viewport (`Tool::PaintLayer`, keyboard `L`); strokes show up live in both the 2D viewport and the 3D viewport (composite RT bound to the terrain shader's diffuse base). ||||
| **Tiled COW mask storage** (`barme_core::layers::mask::TileGrid`) replaces Sprint 15's flat `Vec<u8>` — 256² tiles in either `Tile::Uniform(u8)` (~16 B resident) or `Tile::Pixels(Box<[u8; 65 536]>)` (64 KB resident, allocated lazily on first write). Fresh layers cost ~16 KB regardless of map size; a typical brush stroke touches ~5–20 tiles. Sprint-15 flat-bytes wire format loads cleanly via a custom `Deserialize` that compresses uniform runs on import. ||||
| **Four mask brushes** under the new `MaskBrush` trait — `mask-reveal` / `mask-hide` (smoothstep falloff) / `mask-smooth` (3×3 mean blend, snapshot-then-write to avoid propagation bias) / `mask-fill` (4-connected flood with ±5-of-click-value threshold). `LayerStack::apply_brush(layer_id, brush, stamp)` is the per-stamp dispatcher. ||||
| **GPU composite pipeline** (`composite.wgsl`, ADR-039): bottom-to-front alpha-over of up to 16 layers into a `Rgba8Unorm` offscreen RT clamped at 4096²/axis (PITFALL §5 — maps >8 SMU bilinearly upsample at terrain bind time; the CPU bake stays full `texture_dims` for `.sd7`). Per-layer dirty-tile sub-uploads via `dirty_tiles_since(version)` → `write_composite_layer_mask_tiles` keep the 8 ms NFR honest (a single 200×200 stamp uploads ~64 KB, not the 256 MB a full-mask push would cost). The terrain shader gets binding 7/8 + a `params2.y = 1.0` flag to switch its diffuse base from the Sprint-9 biome/splat composite to a direct composite-RT sample when the project has a non-empty layer stack. ||||
| **Paint viewport** (`ui::paint_view`, ADR-040): ortho top-down render of the composite RT into the central rect at 1:1 aspect with letterboxed bands (PITFALL §8). Pan = middle-drag; zoom = scroll-wheel pivoted on cursor (0.25× – 16× of auto-fit); double-click = reset. Brush ring overlay + status strip (cursor elmo coord + mask byte at cursor + active layer name) + mask-only-preview toggle (chip state ships now, grayscale render is Sprint 17). Fast-drag stamp interpolation (PITFALL §3) prevents gaps. ||||
| **Layers panel** brought forward from Sprint 17's scope per user direction: full add / rename / delete / reorder / opacity / visibility / texture-import experience. The new `inspector_paint_layer` renders a top-down Photoshop-shaped panel; structural mutations re-upload the slot diffuse array + clear the per-layer mask version cache so the next frame resyncs. Demo seed (`seed_demo_accent_layer`) adds a second slot-1 layer at mask=0 on fresh projects so painting reveal/hide immediately produces visible results. Sprint 17 (ADR-041) still owns project-local texture sidecars, drag-to-reorder, per-layer thumbnail, lock toggle, DNTS-channel binding chip, blend-mode selector, and `inspector_splat` retirement. ||||
| Tests: +18 in barme-core (mask round-trips + tile compression + brush invariants + flood-fill correctness), +10 in barme-app (composite uniform layout + RT-clamp + paint-view auto-fit). Workspace total 601 → 614. cargo fmt / clippy / test all green. ||||
| **Out of scope (Sprint 16)** — no DNTS hybrid emission (Sprint 17 / D10 / ADR-041), no `inspector_splat` retirement (Sprint 17), no per-stroke mask undo (deferred to Sprint 19+; tiled COW is the foundation), no per-layer transform editor in UI (data field is in place since Sprint 15; UI is Sprint 17), no blend-mode selector (data hard-coded to `BlendMode::Normal`), no mask grayscale preview rendering (toggle in place), no symmetry replication for mask brushes (Sprint 17), no project-local texture sidecar (imports use the picked path directly). ||||
| **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-20 (Sprint 17 / D10 — ADR-041):** Layered painter trio complete. F4 closes end-to-end. The user's 2026-05-19 "the textures of the end map are quite incredibly ugly" thread is resolved: the `.sd7` ships a composited diffuse from an unlimited stylistic layer stack at full texture resolution, and the bottom ≤4 DNTS-bound layers drive runtime per-fragment normal mapping in BAR. ||||
| **Full Photoshop-style Layers panel** in `crates/barme-app/src/ui/layers_panel.rs`: drag-to-reorder (egui 0.33 `dnd_drag_source` / `dnd_drop_zone`, 64 MB diffuse re-upload gated to drop only), eye visibility + lock chip + per-layer 32 px thumbnail + inline-rename name + DNTS channel chip (R/G/B/A/∅ click-cycle + right-click picker; channel conflicts transfer via two paired `ProjectDiff::SetLayerProperty(DntsChannel)` diffs grouped as one undo step) + opacity slider + delete (×). Active-layer expanded properties section: Source / Transform (Offset X/Y, Scale, Rotation, Mirror X/Y) / Color (tint + brightness) / Blend (combo box, Normal-only) / DNTS bindings (per-layer `tex_scale` 0.0015..=0.05 + `tex_mult` 0.0..=4.0 ramp sliders, only visible when channel-bound; imported-layer warn chip). Footer: layer count + mask-MB chip (warn > 256 MB) + 16-layer-cap chip when exceeded + global `dnts_diffuse_in_alpha` pill toggle. ||||
| **Stock-slot picker dropdown** — new `widgets::slot_picker_grid` + `SlotPickerEntry` extracted from the (now-deleted) `inspector_splat`. The Add-layer split-button's PRIMARY click opens a popup with the slot picker grid at the top (every stock biome with thumbnail + label) + an "Import texture from disk…" button + "Add empty layer (any unused slot)" fallback. The active-layer Source section's "Change slot…" button opens the same picker. Users never HAVE to upload — the stock textures are the default path. (User-driven addition mid-sprint after they pointed out the Add flow was picking arbitrary slots.) ||||
| **Custom texture import** writes into `<project>/textures/<uuid>.png` (PNG re-encode, 8192² max with Lanczos3 downsample, 16² min) + a `<uuid>.meta.toml` sidecar (`name`, `source_filename`, `original_dims`, `imported_at_unix`). `LayerSource::Imported { path }` stores the project-relative path so moved projects keep their textures. Drag-drop dispatches based on `App::layers_panel_rect`: drops over the panel route to `add_layer_at_top + import_layer_texture`. Pre-Sprint-17 absolute / non-`textures/` paths migrate into the sidecar on load via `App::migrate_imported_layer_paths`. New `SlotResolver::imported_root` default-method + `AppSlotResolver::with_project_root` thread the project root through the bake. ADR-027 amended. ||||
| **Per-stroke mask undo** (`HistoryEntry::Mask + MaskEntry + OpenMaskStroke`) adapts ADR-033's heightmap snapshot-then-diff onto the Sprint-16 tiled-COW masks. `LayerMask::clone_tile / restore_tile / tile_coords_overlapping_rect / brush_bbox` expose the snapshot API; `Tile::resident_bytes` drives the cap accounting (Uniform tiles ~24 B, Pixels tiles 64 KB). `History::snapshot_mask_tile` captures before-states per touched tile (first-snapshot-wins); `end_mask_stroke` reads post-states + filters no-op tiles + pushes the entry. App-side: `apply_mask_brush_at_elmos` pre-walks the brush bbox tile set and snapshots; `central_paint_layer`'s `drag_stopped_by(Primary)` branch calls `end_mask_stroke`. Mask brushes also fan through `App::symmetry` (matching the heightmap + splat dispatch patterns) so painting under `SymmetryAxis::Horizontal` mirrors stamps to both halves. Mask-only grayscale preview now actually renders (overlay above the composite RT, red where mask = 0). ||||
| **DNTS hybrid emission** — `barme_pipeline::stage_splat_assets_from_layers` + `materialize_splat_distribution_from_layers` + `populate_resources_from_layers`. Bottom ≤4 DNTS-bound layers materialise into the 1024² splat distribution PNG via a row-streaming box-filter downsample (PITFALL §17.2 — NOT nearest-neighbour). Each bound layer's slot bakes a per-channel DDS via the existing `bake_dnts`. Imported-source DNTS layers emit `LintWarning::ImportedLayerDnts` and skip the DDS bake (no stock normal map to use). `R + G + B + A ≤ 255` holds by construction (one channel per layer; channels independent). `build_sd7` gains `layer_inputs: Option<LayerSplatBakeInputs>` + dispatches on `project.layers.layers.is_empty()`. Runtime DNTS shader uniforms now derive from `LayerStack::dnts_layers()` (per-layer `dnts_tex_scale` / `dnts_tex_mult` / channel binding) — no more `splat_config` reads in the render path. ||||
| **Retirements.** `Tool::SplatPaint` variant + every match arm + `apply_splat_brush_at` (~90 LoC) + `inspector_splat` (~470 LoC) + `bind_slot_to_channel` + `unbind_channel` + `App::splat_brush_state` field + `SplatBrushState` struct + `App::splat_picker_open_for` field — all deleted. `Tool::ALL` shrinks 10 → 9; keyboard `T` is freed. `Project.splat_config` marked `#[serde(skip_serializing, default)]` — new saves drop the legacy block; old loads still hydrate via the wire-side default so `after_load_migrate` can seed the layer stack. `App::splat_config` / `App::splat_distribution` / `App::splat_brushes` / `reupload_bound_slot_diffuses` / `reupload_splat_distribution` — deleted. ||||
| **One-time migration toast** surfaces on first open of a pre-Sprint-14 project (when `after_load_migrate` seeded layers from the legacy `splat_config`). Dismissable via the toast's "Got it" button; `Project.migration_toast_dismissed: bool` (skip-serializing-if-false) persists the dismissal per-project. ||||
| Schema additions: `TextureLayer.dnts_tex_scale` (default 0.02) + `TextureLayer.dnts_tex_mult` (default 1.0) — per-DNTS-bound-layer fields (PITFALL §17.8: legacy `SplatConfig.tex_scales` / `tex_mults` migrate into them). `LayerPropertyValue::DntsTexScale` + `DntsTexMult`. `LayerStack::dnts_layers() -> [Option<&TextureLayer>; 4]` (bottom-most winner per channel + `warn!` on collision). `Project.dnts_diffuse_in_alpha: bool` replaces the per-channel `SplatConfig.diffuse_in_alpha` flag. ||||
| Tests: +11 net across the workspace (barme-core 256 → 264: mask snapshot/restore, mask undo round-trip, imported-root resolution, splat_config-skip-serialize round-trip; barme-pipeline 114 → 117: box-filter downsample smoothness, RGBA invariant, imported-layer lint; barme-app 247 → 240: −7 legacy splat-painter tests deleted, +0 new because the Layers-panel smoke test runs end-to-end via the smoke binary). Workspace total 614 → 621. cargo fmt / clippy / test all green. ||||
| **Out of scope (Sprint 17)** — no pen-pressure input (egui 0.33 limitation), no multi-layer selection, no layer groups/folders (over-design for typical BAR stacks ≤ 6 layers), no adjustment layers / curves / non-destructive filters, no pattern brushes / stamps (slot diffuses are the pattern), no DDS/TGA/TIFF import (PNG/JPG only — convert externally), no live composite preview at > 4096²/axis (Sprint 16 cap stays; full-res CPU bake at `.sd7` time is authoritative), no garbage collection of orphaned imported textures on undo (Sprint 18 polish), no live `Sprint 18+` per-blend-mode selector (`BlendMode` enum has slots for Multiply / Screen / Overlay; only Normal ships). ||||

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17 (Stage 1 opener, F2):** Raise / Lower / Smooth
> shipped via the `barme_core::brushes` plugin-shaped trait + registry
> (ADR-018). New brushes (flatten / erode / noise / terrace / ramp) plug in
> as `impl Brush` + one line in `BrushRegistry::default_set` — no UI or
> dispatch edits. Kernels are CPU; bench at 16 SMU shows ~10× headroom
> against the NFR-Performance budget, so GPU compute port is formally
> deferred (ADR-021).

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17 (Stage 1 opener, F3):** Shipped via
> `barme_core::symmetry::SymmetryAxis` (ADR-019). Covers `None`,
> horizontal / vertical mirror, both (Quad), both diagonals, and
> rotational with a user-editable fold value (`Rotational { fold: 2..=12 }`
> via the side-panel DragValue — 3 for three-player maps, 4 for
> quad-player, etc.). One brush stamp produces N derived stamps; their
> dirty rects union into a single GPU upload. Arbitrary-axis line picker
> is Stage 2.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17 (Stage 1 opener, F14 partial):** The
> math-function subset shipped via `barme_core::procgen::generate`
> (ADR-020). User enters `f(x, z) ∈ [0,1]` and the heightmap is
> regenerated at the project's MapSize. Powered by `evalexpr` v13;
> ships with seven presets (flat / parabolic bowl / dome / cone /
> ridge / ramp / sine ripples). FBM, hydraulic erosion, and river-carve
> remain Stage 2 — they need their own ADR (noise basis function,
> erosion solver choice, river network seeding).

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17 (F8 — shipped):** Phase 2 ADR-023 lands a
> 2D start-position editor in the central preview rect: LMB places /
> drags, RMB deletes. Symmetry from the F3 system replicates the stamp
> through mirror counterparts; team ids are assigned alternating
> even/odd via `barme-core::start_pos::assign_team_ids` (matches BAR's
> per-side `teams[]` convention). `barme_pipeline::mapinfo` emits
> authored teams when present, falling back to the 25/75 default pair
> when the vector is empty. `Project.start_positions` round-trips via
> `serde(default)`. Multi-position bulk operations + symmetry-grouped
> drag remain Phase-3 polish; this commit closes the editor surface F8
> implies.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (F8 — allyteam tree, ADR-032 / B6):** the
> flat `start_positions` shape was wrong for 8v8 / 3-way FFA / 4-way
> FFA — those need an ally-team layer. `Project.start_positions`
> replaced by `Project.ally_groups: Vec<AllyGroup>` (id + name + sRGB
> colour + sources + optional `box_polygon`). Inspector becomes a
> tree with a configuration-preset dropdown (`1v1` / `8v8` /
> `3-way FFA` / `4-way FFA`), per-group collapsing header, and child
> rows for sources + greyed mirror entries. Canvas grows LMB-drag-
> paint: drag distributes N evenly-spaced positions along the vector
> (default 8). Hover↔pulse links the tree to the canvas (Inspector
> row → marker pulse; marker hover → tree scrolls). Markers ghost to
> 50 % alpha outside the StartPositions tool (B1 pattern). Symmetry
> mirrors land in the SAME ally group as the source (sources stored;
> mirrors recomputed each frame). Build path expands sources through
> the active symmetry before emission so the `.sd7` carries every
> spawn the user saw on canvas. Pre-Phase-3 `.barmeproj` migration is
> backwards-compatible: legacy `[[start_positions]]` materialises
> into `ally_groups[0]` via a custom `Deserialize`. ADR-023's data
> shape is superseded; its UX surface (LMB place / drag / RMB delete)
> survives.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17 (F1 — shipped):** Phase 2 ADR-024 lands a
> modal new-project wizard as the app's entry point — auto-opens on
> launch, re-opens via File → New project. Fields: project name
> (sanitised via `sanitize_name`), rectangular `smu_x × smu_z` (2..=64
> each), symmetry preset (incl. user-editable rotational fold), biome
> preset (4 presets from `procgen::BIOMES`, each with a sensible
> `max_height_hint`), max height (64..=4096 elmos). Wires symmetry +
> max-height + biome procgen on Create. Existing in-memory "untitled
> 16×16" auto-start is gone; Cancel restores it as the default. App's
> `map_size_smu: u32` widened to `map_size: MapSize` along the way so
> rectangular survives outside the wizard too.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17 (Project model — start_positions shipped):**
> `Project` now carries `start_positions: Vec<StartPosition>` (F8 /
> ADR-023) with `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Vec::is_empty")]`
> so pre-F8 `.barmeproj` files load forward. Remaining Phase-3+ slots
> (`metal_spots`, `geo_vents`, `features`, `splat_distribution`,
> `mapinfo_overrides`) follow the same pattern when each F-feature
> lands.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (Project model — ally_groups, ADR-032):**
> `Project.start_positions` superseded by `Project.ally_groups:
> Vec<AllyGroup>`. Each group carries id + name + sRGB colour +
> sources + optional `box_polygon` (0..1 fractions feeding
> `mapconfig/map_startboxes.lua` per ADR-029). `StartPosition` is now
> just `(x_elmo: i32, z_elmo: i32)`; team ids are positional at
> emission time. Custom `Deserialize` (via `#[serde(from =
> "ProjectWire")]`) migrates pre-Phase-3 flat `[[start_positions]]`
> into `ally_groups[0]` on load. `team_id` in legacy files is
> ignored via `serde::de::IgnoredAny`.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (F9 — schema shipped; form editor pending):**
> Sprint 4 / C1 / ADR-028 lands the typed `mapinfo.lua` schema at
> `crates/barme-core/src/mapinfo_schema.rs` (`MapInfo` + 9 sub-blocks).
> `MapInfo::bar_default()` populates BAR conventions (modtype 3,
> gravity 130, extractor_radius 80, depend `["Map Helper v1"]`,
> atmosphere fog_start 0.1 / fog_end 1.0, splats tex_scales
> `[0.02; 4]` / tex_mults `[1.0; 4]`, lighting sun_dir as
> `[f32; 4]`). `impl From<&Project> for MapInfo` produces a schema
> instance from the current project, ready to feed the Lua emitter.
> `Project` gained `mapinfo_overrides: HashMap<String, toml::Value>`
> for F9's eventual form-edit bag. **F9 itself (form editor + raw Lua
> tab) is still pending — C7 will wire the UI on top of this schema.**

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (F9 — full BAR-default block, C3):**
> Sprint 6 / C3 fleshes out `MapInfo::bar_default()` with the digest's
> full BAR convention values: lighting colours and shadow densities
> per `Rendering/Env/SunLighting.cpp` defaults, atmosphere wind range
> (5..25) + fog colour + sky colour + sky direction + cloud density,
> and a four-entry `terrain_types` array (Default / Rock / Sand /
> Water) with the canonical `hardness` / `receiveTracks` / `moveSpeeds`
> values. New `MapInfo::bar_default_with_water()` constructor returns
> a struct with the `water` sub-table populated (surface / plane /
> min / base colours, fresnel, perlin params) for projects that opt
> in via `tidal_strength > 0` or `min_height < 0`. The Lua emitter
> already wrote `sunDir` (camelCase) — a regression test now also
> asserts the lowercase `sundir` form does NOT leak out. 11 schema
> tests + 3 emitter tests pin every named default; the smoke test
> checks `gravity == 130`, `extractor_radius == 80`, `modtype == 3`,
> `fog_start != fog_end`, `splats.tex_scales == [0.02; 4]`,
> `terrain_types.len() == 4`.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (BAR source audit, mapinfo + splat
> corrections):** Direct read of `RecoilEngine` + `Beyond-All-Reason`
> + `BYAR-Chobby` clones at HEAD on 2026-05-18 surfaced ten
> load-bearing pitfalls and dozens of field-level corrections vs the
> existing research digest. Full write-up at
> `docs/research/source-audit-2026-05-18/FINDINGS.md`. Highlights
> that change emitter behaviour:
>
> 1. **`lighting.sundir` vs `lighting.sunDir`** — engine reads
>    camelCase only (`MapInfo.cpp:207`); BAR's active
>    `unit_sunfacing.lua` (March 2024) reads lowercase only.
>    Lua tables are case-sensitive — **emitter MUST write BOTH
>    keys** with the same value. The "regression test asserts
>    sundir does NOT leak out" claim in the C3 status above is
>    now incorrect; the test must be inverted to require both
>    keys present in the rendered output. Sprint 6 follow-up
>    item; tracked in the FINDINGS doc.
> 2. **`atmosphere.skyDir` is deprecated** (engine logs
>    `L_DEPRECATED`); use `atmosphere.skyAxisAngle` (float4: xyz
>    rotation axis + radians angle). C3 must rename the field
>    in its `bar_default()` block.
> 3. **Geo vents are NOT a `geos` array in `map_metal_layout.lua`**
>    — that's Zero-K convention. BAR derives geo positions from
>    features with `geoThermal = true`. F6 emits `geovent`
>    feature placements only; the metal-layout file carries
>    only `spots = {...}`. The C2 emitter scaffolding is correct
>    on this point.
> 4. **SMF metalmap MUST be all-zero when emitting Lua spots** —
>    `map_metal_spot_placer.lua` (BAR gadget, raaar 2017) bails
>    if any metalmap pixel is non-zero. F5 must ship a black
>    metalmap PNG to PyMapConv at build time.
> 5. **`lighting.sunDir.w = 1.0` by default**, not `1e9` as the
>    earlier research digest stated. Engine code:
>    `float4(0.0f, 1.0f, 2.0f, 1.0f)` (`MapInfo.cpp:207`).
> 6. **`splatDetailNormalTex` subtable form** —
>    `resources.splatDetailNormalTex = { "a.dds", "b.dds", ...,
>    alpha = true }` is the modern path; the emitter should
>    prefer it over the legacy `splatDetailNormalTex1..4` keys.
> 7. **`modtype` enum** has six values: 0=hidden, 1=primary,
>    2=unused, 3=map, 4=base, 5=menu (per `ArchiveScanner.cpp:83`).
> 8. **`gui.minimapRotation` is unused** by current Recoil — engine
>    reads only `gui.autoShowMetal`. Drop from the C3 emitter
>    defaults if present.
> 9. **`map.voidAlphaMin` exists** (default 0.9, voidGround
>    threshold) and is missing from the current research's field
>    table. Add to F9 schema.
> 10. **PyMapConv does NOT touch `mapinfo.lua`** — it emits SMF +
>     SMT + a `_featureplacement.lua` baked into the SMF feature
>     header. All `mapinfo.lua` + Lua-sidecar emission is the
>     editor's responsibility.
>
> The splat-rendering ADR (anticipated ADR-035 / F4) also picks up
> five corrections — most importantly the tangent basis is built
> from the per-fragment normal (not a static `T=+X / B=+Z`), the
> base normal decodes from `normalsTex.ra` channels only with Y
> derived, and the specular exponent is `α × 16` (flat), not a
> `mix`. See FINDINGS §7 for the full corrected math. The current
> proposed WGSL in `splat-rendering/claude findings.md` will
> render visibly wrong if implemented verbatim.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (Sprint 10 — mapinfo audit fixes
> applied):** Sprint 10 closes the emitter-side gap surfaced by
> the 2026-05-18 source audit above. Five load-bearing fixes
> shipped as six commits on `main`; devlog at
> `devlog/stage-1-mapinfo-audit-fix/`. Each fix cites a PITFALL
> number for traceability:
>
> 1. **`sundir` + `sunDir` dual emit (PITFALL §11).** Lighting
>    block writes BOTH keys with the same 4-float value. The
>    "regression test asserts sundir does NOT leak out" claim from
>    the C3 status above is now correctly inverted —
>    `lighting_emits_both_sundir_keys` requires both.
> 2. **`skyDir` → `skyAxisAngle` (PITFALL §12).**
>    `AtmosphereBlock::sky_dir: Option<[f32; 3]>` removed; replaced
>    with `sky_axis_angle: [f32; 4]` (engine default `[0, 0, 1, 0]`
>    per `MapInfo.cpp:149`). Custom `Deserialize` migrates legacy
>    `sky_dir = [x, y, z]` to `[x, y, z, 0]` so pre-Sprint-10
>    fixtures load forward losslessly.
> 3. **`sunDir.w = 1.0` (PITFALL §18).** Schema default flipped
>    from the stale `1e9` sunStartDistance leakage to the engine's
>    intensity scalar `1.0` per `MapInfo.cpp:213`. The `SunDir`
>    type alias docstring re-flavours W as "intensity scalar".
> 4. **`gui.minimapRotation` dropped (PITFALL §19).** Engine reader
>    at `MapInfo.cpp:119-124` only consumes `autoShowMetal` (which
>    already lives at top-level `MapInfo`). `GuiBlock` removed
>    entirely along with `MapInfo::gui` — no `gui = {}` table
>    emits either.
> 5. **`voidAlphaMin` added + emitted on `voidGround` (PITFALL §20).**
>    `MapInfo::void_alpha_min: f32` with engine default `0.9` per
>    `MapInfo.cpp:107`. Emitter only writes the key when
>    `void_ground = true` to keep dry maps noise-free; F9 will
>    surface the tuner on the same gate.
>
> 17 new regression tests across `barme-core::mapinfo_schema` and
> `barme-pipeline::mapinfo` pin every fix; `cargo test --workspace`
> green at each of the six commits. The two splat-side findings
> (`splatDetailNormalTex` subtable form, FINDINGS §1.8; spec
> exponent `α × 16`, FINDINGS §7.6) are out-of-scope for Sprint 10
> — owned by Sprint 12 / D6 emission wiring + ADR-036 respectively.
> The C8 lint pass (Sprint 14) will surface user-edited overrides
> that re-introduce the deprecated keys.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (F4 — D1, starter texture pack
> shipped):** Sprint 7 / D1 lands the palette decision +
> `scripts/fetch-textures.sh` (ADR-025 + ADR-027). 16 CC0 ambientCG
> slots, 4 biome groups × 4 textures, pinned by sha256. F4 itself
> stays unchecked — gated on D2 (DNTS bake / ADR-026), D3
> (`barme-core::splat`), D4 (fragment shader blend), D5 (splat tool
> UI), D6 (mapinfo emission + `.sd7` bundling).

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (F4 — D2 + D3, pipeline + data model
> shipped):** Sprint 8 / D2 lands `crates/barme-pipeline::dnts::
> bake_dnts` (ADR-026): reads a slot's `normal.png` (+ optional
> `diffuse.{png,jpg}`), Y-flips the green channel iff
> `BakeOptions::yflip_normal` (default `false` for the D1 ambientCG
> `*_NormalGL.png` sources — already OpenGL convention per FINDINGS
> §7.4), composes RGBA8 (RGB = normal, A = `0xFF` baseline or Rec.709
> luma when `diffuse_in_alpha`), BC3-compresses via the vendored
> `compressonatorcli-bin` (ELF invoked directly with
> `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` mirroring the wrapper script — avoids ENOEXEC
> in `cargo test`'s subprocess path on the bash wrapper). Cache
> keyed by `sha256(diffuse_bytes ‖ normal_bytes ‖ opts)` under
> `tools/textures-cache/<sha>.dds` (gitignored). Cache hit ⇒ copy;
> opts toggle ⇒ re-bake. The `diffuse_in_alpha = true` branch is
> plumbed but untested in BAR — high-pass tuning + in-engine A/B
> live behind **ADR-034**.
>
> Sprint 8 / D3 lands `crates/barme-core::splat`: fixed-1024² RGBA
> `SplatDistribution` (independent of map size — the engine samples
> `splatDistrTex` at `uv ∈ [0,1]^2` per `SMFFragProg.glsl:177`),
> `SplatChannel { R, G, B, A }` aligned to the inspector row order,
> object-safe `SplatBrush: Send + Sync + 'static` trait + registry,
> three brushes (`paint`, `erase`, `smooth`) with kebab ids matching
> the inspector's eventual D5 dispatch. `PaintChannel` enforces the
> `R + G + B + A ≤ 255` invariant via floor-scaled others. Brushes
> follow ADR-018's dirty-rect pattern so D4's GPU upload only
> re-pushes the changed bbox. Splat-undo is deferred (4 MB
> distribution × stroke would evict ~25 heightmap strokes from the
> 100 MB cap); follow-up adapts A1's bitset copy-on-first-write.
>
> F4 remains unchecked — visible feature lands when D4 (fragment
> shader blend) + D5 (splat tool UI) ship in Sprint 9, then D6
> (mapinfo emission + `.sd7` bundling) in Sprint 12.
>
> **Source-of-truth note.** The verified palette, sha256-pinned,
> lives in **ADR-025**; the on-disk registry layout lives in
> **ADR-027**. Future texture-pack work reads from those + the
> per-slot `tools/textures/<NN-slot>/meta.toml` files, NOT from
> the Gemini research document. Four hallucinated ambientCG IDs
> (`Grass012`, `Sand002`, `Metal042`, `Organic001`) plus one slot
> collision after the Poly Haven → ambientCG substitution were
> found during D1 verification; they have been corrected in place
> in `docs/research/textures/Gemini BAR Editor Texture Pack
> Scoping.md` so the research file no longer carries false data.
> Gemini's biome structure and bundle-the-normal-map stance were
> kept — only the per-slot asset IDs were unreliable. Same drift
> class as the 2026-05-18 source-audit corrections above:
> secondary research is a sketch; primary sources (ambientCG HEAD
> checks, engine code) bind.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (F14 — procgen UX redesign, B7):**
> Sprint 6 / B7 reorders the Procgen Inspector to preset-first per
> the UI research digests: preset dropdown (auto-detects "Custom"
> when the expression diverges) → `CollapsingHeader` "Custom
> expression" (collapsed by default) → domain radio → 256² greyscale
> preview thumbnail → "Apply to heightmap" button + ✓ / ✗ chip.
> Preview backs to a persistent `egui::TextureHandle` reused via
> `handle.set(image, options)` so the GPU page count stays flat
> across keystrokes. New `barme_core::procgen::generate_thumbnail`
> helper reuses A3's `PixelContext` + precomputed norms; 256²
> cone-peak lands ~25 ms in release. A 50 ms debounce keyed on
> `hash(expr, domain)` coalesces multi-keystroke bursts and flips
> the cache even when the expression string is unchanged but the
> domain toggles. `ctx.request_repaint_after(remaining)` wakes the
> UI loop on quiescence so the preview catches up without busy-
> spinning.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (F1 — demo state on Create, B8):**
> Sprint 6 / B8 turns the wizard's Create button into a true
> "ready to play" handoff. `apply_wizard` now: (1) seeds two start
> positions in `ally_groups[0]` on N / S strips (15 % / 85 % of map
> Z) — runs **after** the biome procgen so a valley-finder can
> dodge the parabolic-dome's peak, falling back to the map
> quarter-points on a miss; (2) reframes the camera at 35° pitch /
> 1.6 × diagonal distance from map centre; (3) opens a non-modal
> `egui::Window` overlay with three accelerator-named bullets
> (B / S / G) pointing at the demo interactions. Wizard's default
> symmetry flipped from `None` → `Horizontal` so the markers line
> up with the symmetry axis without further input. Dismiss
> persists per-project via a new `Project.next_steps_dismissed`
> bool (default false, `skip_serializing_if = "std::ops::Not::not"`);
> a fresh wizard Create on a new project re-shows the hint, by
> design — the user should not have to opt-back-in across
> unrelated projects.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (F11 — Lua AST emitter + three-file
> convention, ADR-029 / C2):** the ad-hoc string formatter at
> `barme-pipeline::mapinfo` is gone. New `barme-pipeline::lua_ast`
> exposes `LuaKey`/`LuaValue` + a 2-space-indent, alpha-sorted,
> trailing-comma renderer. The mapinfo emitter walks the typed
> [`MapInfo`] schema from C1; the BUILD path stages **four** Lua
> files into the `.sd7` (was: one):
> - `mapinfo.lua` (root)
> - `mapconfig/map_metal_layout.lua` (empty placeholder; C4 / C5
>   populate spots + geos)
> - `mapconfig/map_startboxes.lua` (populated from
>   `Project.ally_groups[*].box_polygon` per B6; empty when
>   `ally_groups.len() <= 1`)
> - `mapconfig/featureplacer/features.lua` (empty placeholder;
>   C6 populates)
>
> The renderer is deterministic — repeated builds produce
> byte-identical `.sd7` (NFR-Det), pinned by
> `determinism_repeated_render_byte_identical` in each emitter
> module. `description` escapes `\`, `"`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`
> correctly (round-trip pinned). ADR-013's emitter half is
> superseded; the packaging half (`7z -ms=off`, post-build
> `Solid = -` check, PITFALL #7 defence) remains in force.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (Undo for non-heightmap state — B5):**
> Sprint 4 / B5 lands a unified
> `enum HistoryEntry { Heightmap(HeightmapEntry), Project(ProjectDiff) }`
> stack so F8 start-position edits and F1 wizard applies are
> undoable on the same Ctrl-Z that walks back brush strokes.
> `ProjectDiff` covers `PlaceStartPosition`, `MoveStartPosition`,
> `DeleteStartPosition`, `ApplyWizard(WizardSnapshot)`. Eviction is
> largest-first across both channels so a single long stroke can't
> evict 20 recent F8 placements. Undo/redo gated on
> `!is_dragging_anything()` so the user can't peel back state
> mid-gesture. No new ADR — extends ADR-033's per-stroke COW.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (Canvas affordances — Sprint 3 / B2 B3 B4):**
> The B1 layout shell now has canvas-side feedback for every editor
> session:
> - **B2 / ADR-031** — Symmetry overlay paints dashed mirror axes /
>   rotational spokes through the map centre whenever
>   `symmetry != None`. Sculpt + mirror mode renders mirror-brush
>   ghost rings at every symmetry-derived centre (50% alpha) so the
>   user can predict where the stroke will land. F3 surface.
> - **B3** — Primary brush ring at the cursor (Raise green / Lower
>   red / Smooth blue), nav-gizmo top-right of the viewport (6 axis
>   snaps + drag-orbit), first-launch hint Window persisted via a
>   new `EditorConfig` (TOML at the OS config dir, version-keyed
>   so a major release replays once), and a `?` cheat-sheet modal
>   auto-generated from `Tool::ALL` + a `CAMERA_BINDINGS` table.
>   F2 / F3 / F14 surface; new module `crates/barme-app/src/config.rs`.
> - **B4** — Build & Install promoted from a plain side-panel
>   button to a primary-coloured top-bar Button + `ComboBox` variant
>   selector. Button fill comes from `Visuals::widgets::active.bg_fill`
>   so the future F21 theme toggle stays correct. Bottom status
>   strip now requests a 1 Hz repaint so camera coords keep ticking
>   when nothing else is animating. F11 surface; F12 Launch variant
>   permanently greyed until F12 ships.
> Test counts: `barme-app` 18 → 112 (94 new across overlay / gizmo
> / cheat_sheet / intro / config / app-level). `barme-core` /
> `barme-pipeline` unchanged. No NFR regressions; no new ADRs
> beyond ADR-031.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (Editor layout shell — ADR-030, F2/F3/F8/F14
> UI surfaces re-homed):** The pre-Phase-3 stacked-side-panel UI is gone.
> The editor now uses a five-zone shell: top action bar (File/Edit/Build
> menus + symmetry chip + Build & Install), bottom status strip (camera
> readout + map dims + validation-chip placeholder), left 40 px tool
> strip (Q Select / B Sculpt / S StartPositions / G Procgen), right
> 300 px resizable Inspector (persistent project header + tool-specific
> controls via exhaustive `match`), central wgpu viewport (panel
> add-order LAST). Tool-specific state stays on `App`, not
> `ui.memory()`. Single-active-tool `Tool` enum has room for Phase 4
> Splat / Metal / Feature variants without dispatch-site changes — the
> exhaustive match enforces handling. Drag threshold raised to 8 px
> (`InputOptions::max_click_dist`) to disambiguate click-place from
> drag-paint. Symmetry promotion from Sculpt-only radio to top-bar chip
> + popover preserves the existing controls (B2 / ADR-031 adds the
> canvas overlay). All Phase-2 features still reachable: Ctrl-Z undo,
> F8 placement, F1 wizard via File → New, Procgen Apply, symmetry
> mirror replication. 8 new unit tests pin the Tool enum and set_tool
> invariants; 3 more pin Phase 2 smoke paths
> (`b1_does_not_regress_*`).

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-19 (UI visual overhaul — ADR-035, design-mockup
> adoption):** Within the same five-zone shell, the editor's visual
> identity, widget library, and per-panel content were overhauled to
> match the Claude Design mockup at `docs/research/ui/`. **Structural
> layout is unchanged** — panel add-order, the exhaustive-`match` tool
> dispatch, and ADR-030's invariants all still hold. What did change:
>
> - **Theme + widget library:** new `crates/barme-app/src/ui/theme.rs`
>   (single `Tokens::DARK` palette — bg / panel / hover / border /
>   accent / chip-tone colours) and `crates/barme-app/src/ui/widgets.rs`

>   (M), `Tool::GeoFeatures` (F) added alongside Select / Sculpt /
>   StartPositions / Procgen. Tile renders 36 × 36 line-icon + letter
>   underneath; active state = filled accent bg + 2 px left rail.
> - **Top action bar:** brand chip, File / Edit / **View** (new — grid /

>   symmetry cluster** (pill toggle + mode dropdown + fold spinner —
>   replaces the popover-only widget), right-aligned **validation chip**

### 3.3 Non-functional requirements

- **NFR-Performance:** Brush stroke latency ≤ 8 ms on a 16×16 map at 60 fps preview on a mid-range 2020 GPU.
- **NFR-Memory:** Resident set ≤ 4 GB editing a 16×16 map; ≤ 8 GB at 32×32.
  - **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-18 (A1 / ADR-033):** undo history now obeys
    the 100 MB ring cap reliably. The prior per-stamp snapshot model
    (ADR-022) blew past that cap by 2-3× on long brush strokes —
    single stroke at radius 1024 captured ~244 MB on a 16-SMU map.
    Copy-on-first-write within a stroke bounds a single `UndoEntry` at
    `bbox.w × bbox.h × 2 bytes` (≤ ~2 MB at 16 SMU, ≤ ~9 MB at 32
    SMU), independent of stamp count.
- **NFR-Portability:** Single static binary on Windows x86_64 and Linux x86_64; AppImage for Linux. No system-wide install required.
- **NFR-Toolchain:** Bundle PyMapConv + Compressonator under a `tools/` subdirectory of the executable.
  Also requires the host system to provide a 7-Zip binary (`7z` / `7zz` / `7za`) — declared in install docs, not bundled.
- **NFR-Determinism:** Same project → byte-identical `.sd7` (compile timestamps stripped).
- **NFR-Crash safety:** Autosave every 60 s to disk-backed project file.
- **NFR-Audit:** Emitted mapinfo.lua is human-readable, diff-friendly, and matches BAR community style.
- **NFR-Observability:** All operations are traced via `tracing` with consistent severity levels —
  `error!` on operation failure, `warn!` on degradation / defensive catches, `info!` on lifecycle
  (load / save / build / generate / adapter selection), `trace!` on per-stamp brush diagnostics.
  UI error strings render full `#[source]` chains via `{e:#}`. Boot logs include backend, adapter
  name, vendor, and device type so bug reports include the GPU context out-of-the-box.

> **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17:** NFR-Toolchain corrected — ADR-004 replaced
> nvdxt.exe with AMD Compressonator (ADR-014 vendors it separately under
> `tools/compressonator/`). NFR-Observability added after the Stage 1
> logging audit; convention is documented in ADR-018 / ADR-019 / ADR-020.
> NFR-Crash safety (autosave) is still aspirational — Phase 2+ work.

### 3.5 Data flow (terrain edit → playable)

1. User drags brush; UI emits a sequence of `BrushStamp { world_x, world_z, radius, strength }` values, one per frame the pointer is held.
2. **STATUS UPDATE (ADR-018 / ADR-021):** stamps are applied by **CPU kernels** in `barme_core::brushes` (the GPU compute path described in earlier drafts is formally deferred — bench shows ~10× headroom in the CPU implementation; see ADR-021). The CPU `Heightmap` is the source of truth; the affected pixel rect is sub-uploaded to the GPU r16uint storage texture via a single `queue.write_texture` call (ADR-017).
3. Symmetry replicates each stamp into N derived centers via `SymmetryAxis::replicate`; their dirty rects union into one upload (ADR-019).
4. Vertex shader samples the GPU heightmap texture per-vertex every frame; the per-frame uniform carries the camera matrix + `max_height` (changing height-scale costs zero buffer churn).
5. On Save: in-memory `Heightmap` flushed to a sibling PNG; project manifest written as `<name>.barmeproj` TOML. On Build: in-memory heightmap serialised to a temp PNG → PyMapConv subprocess → mapinfo emitter → 7-Zip non-solid packaging → optional install into BAR's user maps dir (ADR-015).

### 3.6 User stories (top 5)

- *As a new mapper*, I want a "Quicksilver-like 16×16 starter" template so I can iterate without reading the wiki.
- *As a competitive mapper*, I want guaranteed pixel-exact 4-way rotational symmetry so my map is tournament-acceptable.
- *As a mapper testing variants*, I want a "Reroll with seed" button on procedural terrain that preserves my symmetry and metal-spot intent.
- *As a returning mapper*, I want to drop an existing `.sd7` onto the editor and continue editing it.
- *As any mapper*, I want one button to compile and launch BAR with my map loaded.

## Phase 4 — Tech Stack Recommendation

### Decision: Rust + egui/eframe + wgpu, PyMapConv as sidecar.

| Stack | CrossPlat | Perf | GUI maturity | Single-binary | mapconv glue | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Rust + egui/eframe + wgpu** | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ✅ static-linked | ✅ subprocess | **CHOSEN** |
| Tauri + WebGPU + Rust backend | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ⚠ needs WebView2/WebKitGTK | ✅ | Runner-up; WebKitGTK rendering inconsistency on Linux is the killer for a heavy 3D viewport |
| C++ + Qt6 + OpenGL/Vulkan | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ⚠ Qt6 LGPL implies dynamic link or commercial license for true single-binary | ✅ | Industrial-strength but slow iteration, complex Linux packaging |
| Python + PyQt6 + ModernGL | ★★★★ | ★★ | ★★★★ | ❌ PyInstaller bundles are 100–300 MB, slow startup | ✅ trivially | Tempting because PyMapConv is already Python, but brush latency at scale is the show-stopper |
| Electron + Three.js | ★★★★ | ★★ | ★★★★★ | ❌ 150 MB+ | ✅ | Rejected: heavy terrain in WebGL inside Chromium violates "performant" |
| **Godot 4 as a tool** | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ✅ exports single binary | ⚠ subprocess works but is awkward | Strong contender; built-in 3D viewport, GDScript productivity. **The credible alternative if Rust's learning curve is too steep.** |
| Unity as a tool | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ⚠ requires runtime | ✅ | Rejected: licensing, runtime distribution, "single executable" is a fiction in Unity. (Note: `tebeer/BARMapEdit` chose this path and stalled at 22 commits with zero users.) |
| Java + JavaFX | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ⚠ requires JRE or jlink image (~80 MB) | ✅ | Rejected: SpringMapEdit tried it, died |
| Pure web app (WebGPU) | ★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ❌ cannot package PyMapConv | ❌ | Rejected: the build step needs native binaries |

### Why Rust + egui + wgpu specifically

1. **Single static binary** on Windows (MSVC) and Linux (musl). No bundled runtime, no install step.
2. **wgpu** is the right abstraction for a heightmap editor's compute pipeline: compute shaders for brush kernels, R16 storage textures, indirect rendering for feature instancing, and a clean fallback from Vulkan/Metal/DX12 to GL.
3. **egui/eframe** is production-proven in this exact niche: per `rerun.io/docs/howto/visualization/extend-ui`, the **Rerun Viewer** ("built on top of egui and wgpu") visualizes 3D point clouds, tensors, and images in real time — and egui's CTO/author works on Rerun. egui's immediate-mode model matches the "describe UI from project state every frame" pattern that suits an editor with heavy undo/redo.
4. **PyMapConv subprocess** is trivial via `std::process::Command`. Bundle PyMapConv's PyInstaller exe under `tools/pymapconv.exe` (Windows) and `tools/pymapconv` (Linux), plus `nvdxt` under `tools/`. The user installs *nothing*. — **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17 (ADR-011/ADR-014):** Linux bundling is two trees, not one: PyMapConv at `tools/pymapconv/` and AMD Compressonator at `tools/compressonator/`. Both fetched by sha256-pinned scripts (`scripts/fetch-pymapconv.sh`, `scripts/fetch-compressonator.sh`). The `nvdxt` mention is obsolete (ADR-004 — Linux uses Compressonator).
5. **Containerization fallback:** Recoil's headless mode and PyMapConv both run cleanly under Docker, so a CI image is straightforward for headless build/test of generated maps. `beyond-all-reason/maps-metadata` already ships a Dockerfile-based build flow (`docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/build maps-metadata-build`) you can mirror.
6. **Performance budget verified by precedent:** Rerun handles real-time 3D scene visualization on egui + wgpu; wgpu compute on a 1025² R16 heightmap is sub-millisecond.

### Fallback: Godot 4 (C# or GDScript)

If the wgpu compute curve is too steep, Godot 4 exports a single executable for Windows/Linux, ships a robust 3D viewport, and has the **HTerrain plugin by Zylann** (`github.com/Zylann/godot_heightmap_plugin`, Godot 4.1+), whose documentation states it "supports level of details on the geometry using a quad tree … divided in chunks of 32×32 (or 16×16 depending on your settings)" — exactly the LOD/chunked heightmap rendering needed here. Call PyMapConv via `OS.execute`. The cost is a less-polished docking UI and a binary size of ~93 MB on Windows with default Godot export settings (reducible to ~35 MB with build flags, per `popcar.bearblog.dev` benchmarks) versus 15–25 MB for a Rust + egui binary.

### Existing-editor reuse decision

- **Fork PyMapConv:** No — use it as-is, vendored. It already works.
- **Fork SpringBoard:** No — it is Lua + in-engine; pulling its rendering out of Spring is a multi-month task.
- **Fork tebeer/BARMapEdit:** No — no license, no README, no community, Unity-based. Take it only as evidence that a Unity+ImGui approach is technically possible but lonely.
- **Fork hendkai/bar-map-generator:** No — it is a web procedural generator, not an editor.
- **Build the new tool fresh in Rust + egui + wgpu, calling PyMapConv as a sidecar.** This is the verdict.

## Recommendations (staged)

**Stage 0 — Validation (2 weeks).** Build a small Rust prototype that (a) loads a 16-bit PNG heightmap, (b) renders it as a meshed terrain in wgpu, (c) writes a fake project to disk, (d) shells out to PyMapConv and produces a valid `.sd7`, (e) launches BAR with that map. Goal: confirm the sidecar contract works end-to-end. **Go/no-go gate.** If PyMapConv on the target platform cannot be driven headless reliably, fall back to Godot 4 + HTerrain.

**Stage 1 — MVP (3–4 months).** Implement F1–F12. Ship a Windows `.exe` and a Linux AppImage. Have Beherith (or another active BAR mapper) review the output `.sd7` byte-for-byte against PyMapConv reference output for three test maps. Publish on `beyondallreason.info/guide/mapmaking-resources` as a beta tool.

**Stage 2 — v1 (additional 4–6 months).** Add F13–F17. Add a procedural template library matching popular BAR maps (Quicksilver, Glitters, Throne, Supreme Isthmus archetypes). Add a "Lint My Map" pass that catches all ten silent mapinfo.lua pitfalls in §2.1.

**Stage 3 — v2 (open-ended).** F18–F20, plus a "publish to BAR" wizard that opens a PR against `beyond-all-reason/maps-metadata` with the generated YAML row.

**Thresholds that change the plan:**
- If PyMapConv stops being maintained, or if Beherith refuses redistribution, **pivot** to an embedded Rust-native SMF/SMT writer using the `texpresso`/`bcdec` crates; add ~2 months.
- If Recoil ever changes the SMF binary format (it has not in 10+ years, but Recoil is forking actively), the embedded writer must follow.
- If brush latency on Linux + Intel iGPU exceeds 16 ms at 32×32 maps, drop to a CPU-tile-update path with a coarser preview LOD.

## Caveats

- **License clarity on PyMapConv is unresolved.** The repo carries no SPDX license file. Get explicit written permission from Beherith before redistribution; this is non-negotiable for a public release. — **STATUS UPDATE 2026-05-17 (ADR-003):** resolved; upstream now carries `CC0-1.0`. Redistribution is unblocked.
- **The "final look" in BAR will diverge from in-editor preview** because Recoil's actual ground shader (DNTS + PBR + atmospheric scatter + dynamic shadows) is far more complex than what a tool should reimplement. Document the gap up front; do not pretend WYSIWYG.
- **No standalone GUI map editor for BAR is currently maintained.** The closest active artifact — `tebeer/BARMapEdit` — has 0 stars, no README, no license, 22 commits, and is invisible to the BAR mapping community. This is an opportunity, not a threat: every existing guide opens with Beherith's warning, *"THERE IS NO INGAME MAP EDITOR FOR BAR."*
- **Recoil is an actively forking engine.** Pin against a Recoil release tag in CI and re-test on every release.
- **World Machine remains the de-facto procedural backbone for top-tier BAR maps.** A v1 editor will not displace it for elite mappers; aim instead at the long tail of mappers who today bounce off the toolchain entirely.
